# IFC 4.3 - Utils
This is the **utility repository** for the testing and validation process of the IFC 4.3. It contains source code and synthetic cases for IFC 4.3 files. 

## How the repository is structured
* addCheck: source for checking the continuity of alignment segments and consistency between geometry and semantics
* EnrichIFC4x3: source for generating alignment geometry based on semantic information
* AddIndexedPolyCurve: source for adding indexed polycurve (point list) for alignment geometry
* alignment_testset: compiled applications with a set of test files that covers all different types of alignment segments.
* alignmentconsistency: alignment checks similar to addCheck but with `json` output
in place of `html`.
